# Climate Data Visualization

This repository contains interactive visualizations of climate data using Plotly.

## About

These visualizations were created using Python and Plotly as part of a data science project.

## Visualizations

1. [Monthly Temperature Trends](https://github.com/Feifenyx/CS5304-A2-Viz/blob/main/q4_a.html)
   - Shows monthly average temperatures at Cornell Tech from 1950 to 2021.
   - Features an interactive slider for year selection.

2. [Annual Temperature Threshold](https://github.com/Feifenyx/CS5304-A2-Viz/blob/main/q4_b.html)
   - Displays the first year when Cornell Tech's annual average temperature exceeded 55°F.
   - Includes a line graph with the threshold year highlighted.

3. [Climate Correlation Dashboard](https://github.com/Feifenyx/CS5304-A2-Viz/blob/main/q4_c.html)
   - Examines the relationship between local temperatures at Cornell Tech, global CO₂ levels from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and global temperature anomalies from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
   - Features multiple data series and climate milestone markers.
